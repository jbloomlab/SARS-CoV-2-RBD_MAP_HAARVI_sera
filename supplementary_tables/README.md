# Supplementary tables for manuscript
The supplementary tables for the manuscript are also organized here for clarity. 

## [Table S1](./TableS1.csv) Patient metadata and neutralization titers of convalescent plasma pre- and post-depletion of RBD-binding antibodies, related to Figure 1.
This table contains the sample metadata from the second supplementary file of [Crawford, et al. (2020)](https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaa618/5916372) as well as the neutralization titers measured in the present study. Each plasma is listed twice (on two rows), one with the pre-depletion serological measurements, and one with the post-depletion serological measurements. This table also links the sample nomenclature used in Crawford et al. (2020) to that used in the present study (subject _). The table is also available [here](https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_MAP_HAARVI_sera/blob/main/experimental_validations/results/rbd_absorptions/rbd_depletion_foldchange_ic50.csv).

## [Table S2](./Table2.xlsx) Percentage of RBD mutant library that fell into FACS “escape gate” for each plasma during the mapping, related to Figure 2.
Plasma is a unique identifier for each plasma mapped, PID is the patient ID from (Crawford et al., 2020a), subject is the simpler patient identifier used for patients in the current study, the selection plasma dilution indicates the reciprocal dilution at which each selection was performed (i.e., 500 is a 1:500 dilution of plasma) and the 4 rightmost columns indicate the percentage of each population of cells that fell into the antibody-escape selection gate for the duplicate mutant libraries (lib1 and lib2) and for cells expressing unmutated RBD and incubated with the same dilution of plasma as the mutant libraries (WT 1x) or 10-fold less plasma (WT 0.1x).
There are no corresponding raw FACSDiva gating plots for expt_36 (subject K (day 29)) in Figure S2.

# [Table S3](./TableS3.csv) Measurements of the effects of mutations on binding by polyclonal human plasma, related to Figure 2.
The file gives the “escape fraction” for each mutation, as well as the total escape fraction at each site and the maximum escape fraction for any mutation at the site.

## [Table S4](../results/mutant_neuts_results/mutants_foldchange_ic50.csv): Raw IC50 values and fold-change IC50 for each RBD mutant tested in pseudovirus neutralization assays is available
These are the values shown in Figures 5 and S5.
