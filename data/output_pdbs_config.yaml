# Information about outputting B-factor re-assigned PDBs and dms-view inputs
#
# Top-level keys are PDBs
# Under each PDB key, specify:
#  pdbfile -> path to file containing PDB
#  chains -> list of chain(s) to which we map colors, typically RBD chains
#  conditions -> conditions (antibodies / sera) for which we write this PDB,
#                set to ALL  for all conditions
